First off, I'll teach you basic movement skills. The keys A, and D are used for movement and the W key
is used to jump.
X Key: Continue

Go ahead and move to the right by pressing the D key.
D Key: Move right.

When you're in the air, you can change directions by using the A and D keys. This will make it easier
to jump onto platforms.

Allright. Enough talk. Let's practice a bit, shall we? After all, if we're gonna overthrow the Swace Empire,
we better be prepared.

Alright, now that you have the basic movement down, it's time to learn how to shoot. 
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Over the past several thousand years, our race has evolved to allow us to fire concentrated balls
of energy.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
These balls of energy, also called Manupians can be fired out of your hands and don't inflict any physical
damage on you.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
However, your Manupians carry with them millions of microbes that can damage human tissue.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
You're immune against your own Manupians since the microbes are generated from remnants of your
DNA. If you fire Manupians at anyone else however, the microbes damage their tissue.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
In short, you can fire your Manupians like a weapon at your opponents. Beware, however, that opponents
can do the same to you with their Manupians.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
I'm going to give you a quick demonstration of what firing Manupians looks like. Don't worry, I've
injected us with parts of each other's DNA so that we're immune against each other's Manupians.

To get the full effect of firing however, I recommend that you hold your mouse button pressed.
This will create a nice stream of Manupians. Go ahead and try it!

Ok! Now use the cross hair to aim.

Notice that you're not able to shoot at anything during a cutscene. As soon as the cutscene ends you'll
be able to inflict damage again.
X Key: Continue

Ok. Now that you learned how to fire your Manupians, go ahead and do some target practice with the
dummies that I've scattered throughout my training area.

Ok, now that you've learned the basics of firing your Manupians, it's time to learn about the different
Weapons available.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Throughout the Swace Empire, you'll find weapons that you can pick up. Once picked up, your DNA
temporarily adopts the power and function of the weapon.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
In other words, once you pick up the weapons scattered throughout the Empire, you can use them for a
short period of time.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Since actions speak louder than words, it's probably best to try it out. Just like before, go through the
training stage and destroy the dummies and targets.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Only now, you'll find weapons falling down that you can pick up. Pick up the weapons by running into
them.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace

All of your picked up weapons are displayed in the head up display under Temporary Weapons.
You can pick up and fire multiple weapons at a time.
X Key: Continue

Go ahead and experiment with the weapons and observe their effects on the dummies and targets.

Great! Looks like you're getting the basics of Ace Fighting down quite well! There's just one last
fundamental lesson I have to teach you before we can take on the Swace Empire.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
That last lesson is about the use of special weapons and it is one of the most important skills that
you're learning here in my training area.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
What are special weapons, you ask? Well, the blue statistics screen you just saw before listed among
other things, the special weapons you earned.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Like the temporary weapons you find all around the Swace Empire, special weapons merge with your
DNA to allow you to use their power.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
The difference between temporary weapons and special weapons, however, is that special weapons
last much longer. Once obtained, special weapons can be used throughout an entire level.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Alright, like before, I think it's best that we try out these special weapons.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Before we do that, however, it's important to understand the basic concept of the special weapons.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Even though I said, that special weapons last you throughout an entire level, they do have a limitation.
That limitation is your special meter.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
As long as your special meter is not empty, your special weapons can be used. However, once the
special meter is empty, you can't use your special weapon.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Don't worry though because your special meter replenishes itself automatically, so after a short while
you'll be able to use your special weapons again.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Once we begin our journey to overthrow the evil emperor Iron Man Dan, you'll be able to find ways
to increase the amount of special in your special meter.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Alright, let's get down to using our special weapons. To switch to your special weapons, press the S key.
S Key: Switch to special weapons.
KeyPress_s Dialog
Ace
3
Notice how your special weapons are highlighed in your HUD. This indicates that you're now using
your special weapons.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
To use your special weapon simply fire just like you usually would, using the left mouse button.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Notice how you're firing your special weapons now. Also notice how your special meter is being
depleted as you fire.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Stop firing to allow your special meter to replenish again.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Alright, to switch back to your normal weapons, either use up all your special or press the S key again.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Ok. Experiment with your special weapons and make it to the end of the level to finish your training.
Remember, after this, our journey to overthrow the Swace Empire will begin so make sure you're ready.

Hello Benny. I think we're ready to commence our mission.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace

As you know, Swace was once a sprawling interstellar empire. Other empires admired us for the strides
we had made in the sciences, particularly the Manupian sciences.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Swace was also renowned for its freedom and civil liberties. Many people fled other, oppressive states
to seek harbor in Swace.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
To sum it up, Swace was once among the most powerful and righteous empires in the interstellar
community...
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
...until Iron Man Dan came to power.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Iron Man Dan worked his way up in the Swace senate for two decades until he finally won one of the
Key Empire Seats.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
What are the Key Empire Seats, you ask? Basically, if something happens to the Emperor, the members
of the senate vote for one of the Key Empire senators to replace the Emperor until the next election.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
So now that Iron Man Dan was one of the Key Empire Senators, all he had to do to become the Swace
Emperor was take the current Emperor out of play and win the senate's Key Empire election...
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
And that's exactly what he did. Sure enough, only two months after Iron Man Dan had become one of
the Key Empire Senators, Emperor Calcus fell into a coma.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Two weeks after that, he died...
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
By the time Emperor Calcus passed, Iron Man Dan had placed all the men he needed to win the Key
Empire election into the senate.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
2
Needless to say, Iron Man Dan won the Key Empire election and became the new Emperor of Swace.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Immediately after taking office, Iron Man Dan declared martial law. This made it easy for him to bend
the Empire's Consitution to his will without the citizens being able to do anything about it...
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Iron Man Dan thus rewrote parts of the Swace Constitution to read that he was the new permanent
Emperor.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
He then proceeded to suspend civil liberties indefinitely because he felt that enforcing them would just
require more administrative overhead.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
As you can see, Iron Man Dan has managed to turn Swace into an evil, manipulative and oppressive
empire.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Which is why I've started a small rebel force known as the Ace Fighters. The truth is, the citizens are
fed up with Iron Man Dan's fascist policies, they're just too afraid and disorganized to take a stand.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
If we can just take down a few key parts of Iron Man Dan's regime, we can motivate the citizens of
Swace to topple the government.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
What key parts, you ask? The first and one of the primary support structures of Iron Man Dan's Empire
is the Swace Military.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace

An old friend and former student of mine by the name of Danilo, is a general in the Swace army.
With his help we can incapacitate the Swace war machine.
X Key: Continue

Your mission, now, is to make your way to the edge of the city of Swaylonia and meet up with Danilo

I've already contacted Danilo, so he should be expecting you.

Be careful though. The city is filled with police. Martial law is in place, and there's a 20 hour curfew.
If the police see you, they won't hesitate to shoot you with their Manupians.
