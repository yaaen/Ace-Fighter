Hello Benny. I think we're ready to commence our mission.

As you know, Swace was once a sprawling interstellar empire. Other empires admired us for the strides
we had made in the sciences, particularly the Manupian sciences.

Swace was also renowned for its freedom and civil liberties. Many people fled other, oppressive states
to seek harbor in Swace.
X Key: Continue

Ace

To sum it up, Swace was once among the most powerful and righteous empires in the interstellar
community...

...until Iron Man Dan came to power.

Iron Man Dan worked his way up in the Swace senate for two decades until he finally won one of the
Key Empire Seats.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace

What are the Key Empire Seats, you ask? Basically, if something happens to the Emperor, the members
of the senate vote for one of the Key Empire senators to replace the Emperor until the next election.
X Key: Continue

So now that Iron Man Dan was one of the Key Empire Senators, all he had to do to become the Swace
Emperor was take the current Emperor out of play and win the senate's Key Empire election...
X Key: Continue

Ace

And that's exactly what he did. Sure enough, only two months after Iron Man Dan had become one of
the Key Empire Senators, Emperor Calcus fell into a coma.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace

Two weeks after that, he died...
X Key: Continue

Ace

By the time Emperor Calcus passed, Iron Man Dan had placed all the men he needed to win the Key
Empire election into the senate.
X Key: Continue

Ace

Needless to say, Iron Man Dan won the Key Empire election and became the new Emperor of Swace.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog

Immediately after taking office, Iron Man Dan declared martial law. This made it easy for him to bend
the Empire's Consitution to his will without the citizens being able to do anything about it...
X Key: Continue

Ace

Iron Man Dan thus rewrote parts of the Swace Constitution to read that he was the new permanent
Emperor.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
He then proceeded to suspend civil liberties indefinitely because he felt that enforcing them would just
require more administrative overhead.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
As you can see, Iron Man Dan has managed to turn Swace into an evil, manipulative and oppressive
empire.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
Which is why I've started a small rebel force known as the Ace Fighters. The truth is, the citizens are
fed up with Iron Man Dan's fascist policies, they're just too afraid and disorganized to take a stand.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace
3
If we can just take down a few key parts of Iron Man Dan's regime, we can motivate the citizens of
Swace to topple the government.
X Key: Continue
KeyPress_x Dialog
Ace

What key parts, you ask? The first and one of the primary support structures of Iron Man Dan's Empire
is the Swace Military.
X Key: Continue

An old friend and former student of mine by the name of Danilo, is a general in the Swace army.
With his help we can incapacitate the Swace war machine.

Your mission, now, is to make your way to the edge of the city of Swaylonia and meet up with Danilo
at the Swaylonia Military Base.

I've already contacted Danilo, so he should be expecting you.

Be careful though. The city is filled with police. Martial law is in place, and there's a 20 hour curfew.
If the police see you, they won't hesitate to shoot you with their Manupians.

I've done some research and the best and fastest way to reach the end of town is by getting down to the
city streets. From there you can get into the sewers.
X Key: Continue

The sewers will take you to the edge of town. From there it should just be a short walk on a country
road until you reach the Swaylonia Military Base.

Benny, I have no idea what they're talking about... Maybe they're government agents disguised as

They're not working for General Danilo, that's for sure... If they won't let us into the complex, you'll
just have to fight your way in. Take them out and you should be able to get in.

The only difference, really, is that you don't have the guts to make that vision happen yourself.

So that's what this is about? You know that that was an accident. I came and helped you!

That's not the point, Ace. The point is that, despite events like those, you still try to impose your
views by sending other people to do all the dirty work for you.

I mean look now, for instance. You've sent yet another one of your errand boys to do the work you

You'll be fine, though. Danilo was never as strong of a student as you were. That's why he has to have

To take out the Anitron, simply destroy its cockpit. You can also destroy its turrets but that won't be
enough. You must take out the cockpit if you want to defeat the Anitron.
